    <h1>The Best Movies According to Christine</h1>
    <h2>My top movies of all time (not in order).</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Crazy Rich Asians</h3>
    <p>
      This film has some refreshing representation of Chinese Americans and
      their related family perspectives. I love how this movie achieved being a
      fun romcom while also having the main character overcome a struggle of
      selfworth and confidence. These struggles were overcome without the main
      character winning the romantic interest or the romantic interest
      <em>saving</em>
      the main character.
    </p>
    <h3>Ever After</h3>
    <p>
      This is a historical romance classic. We get to see the main character
      thrive during conversations of higher learing. Her concern for lower and
      upper classes provides a space for philosophical queries that can still
      apply today. This is also another great example of a main character
      resolving most of her issues without the assistance of the romantic
      interest.
    </p>
    <h3>Old Guard</h3>
    <p>
      This movie felt monumental in the fact that the women in this movie were
      never sexualized. It was also monumental because of its representation
      that included main characters of multiple nationalities as well as a
      developed LGBGTQ+ relationship.
    </p>
    <h3>The Lord of the Rings series</h3>
    <p>
      I doubt any book to movie series reaches this level of accuracy. While
      many people will rank Game of Thrones as one of the best fantasy series,
      it still lacks a quality that Lord of the Rings does not - Women main
      characters being classicly sexualized. The Lord of the Rings shows that
      you can still have political intrigue, high risk, many countries involved
      while not bending to the desire to show women getting sexualized, raped,
      and mutilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will say both of these movies fall short in properly showing
      represenatation. The original Lord of the Rings series has the typical
      dark and light skin archetypes. Game of Thrones does show a wider variety
      of people, but those of darker skin are often considered "exotic" or
      "barbaric".
    </p>
    <h3>The Dressmaker</h3>
    <p>
      The cinematography in this movie is absolutely gorgeous! I love the way
      that we can view contrasts between the past and present through color and
      camera perspective. The characters have been developed in such a unqiue
      way! Again, this move demonstrates that a woman main character does not
      need a man to solve their problems.
    </p>
    <h3>My Name</h3>
    <p>
      My reason for loving this series is similar to why I love Old Guard. The
      main character is never sexualized. The fighting is messy and portrayed
      very similarly to a typical violent masculine lead film. This is another
      series that typifies that the woman main character will not need a man to
      resolve their iessues. My one concern with this series is that I don't
      think it would pass the Bechdel test.

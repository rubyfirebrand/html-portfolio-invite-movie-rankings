  I am a self taught developer who has a passion for having functional and
  visually pleasing websites. My goal is to have a clear communication and
  vision for each project to make sure each client is satisfied with their
  platform. My foundations are built in troubleshooting bugs and working as a
  quality assurance specialist for online platforms. I have built on that
  knowledge through independent learning and work experience with HTML, CSS,
  Bootstrap. I am continuing education in other languages and frameworks. In my
  freetime, I enjoy relaxing in the outdoors, creating chai and herbal teas, and
  getting lost in another world through books or shows.
